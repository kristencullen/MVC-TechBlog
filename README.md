# MVC-TechBlog
## Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop a CMS-style blog site, similar to a WordPress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts. This site will be built entirely from scratch and deployed to Render. The application will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, utilizing Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Technologies Used
MVC Architecture: To structure the application.
Handlebars.js: As the templating engine to dynamically generate HTML.
Sequelize: To interact with the PostgreSQL database.
express-session: For session management and authentication.
Render: For deploying the application.
## Deployment
The application will be deployed on Render, ensuring it is accessible to users and allowing for a seamless blogging experience.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide developers with a platform to share their technical knowledge and opinions. By following the MVC paradigm and leveraging modern web technologies, the resulting application will be robust, maintainable, and user-friendly.
